##Contents
This repo contains the following documents in relation to the course project for Module 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data of the Data Scientist Signature Track on Coursera run by the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:

1. Readme.md (this document)

2. CodeBook.md

Contains the details of variables, units and values contained in the tidy data set (tidy_data.txt)

3. run_analysis.R

Contains all R Programming code to process the entire result of the Course Project, without any requirement for manual user input. Descriptions of the specific functions of each section of code is contained within the document/file itself for easy reference.

4. tidy_data.txt

Contains the final output required for the Course Project i.e. tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Specific Instructions for run_analysis.R
The script is coded to check for the required files for the Course Project (located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), download it if necessary, unzip the contents, install and load all the required R packages and execute all the steps up to and including writing the final tidy data set to tidy_data.txt.

As such, all that is required is to execute the run_analysis.R script to get the final output. There is no need to manually download the required files,unzip the files or load/install R packages.

All the above will be performed in the R working directory.
